### Project Title
**EDA of the Bikeshare Data Files in R**

### Description
This is exploratory data analysis of the Motivate dataset submited as
a project for the R course in Udacity's _Introduction to Programing 
for Data Science_ [syllabus here](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree-with-R--nd118)

### Files and programs used
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv

I used the **R-Studio** to do the EDA. The final project was submitted on
a **Jupyter Notebook**


### Credits
I appreciate the ggplot2 tutorial by Thomas Pedersen [here](https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68)
The textbook _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund
was pivotal in my further understanding of concepts
